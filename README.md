# RC3 web ui!

## how to dev

- see [HOWTODEV-OAUTH](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/rctv/blob/main/docs/HOWTODEV-OAUTH.md) from the RCTV project for the steps
-- very tldr: start the server, start ngrok, have an oauth dev app pointing to ngrok, and have a recurse domain for the dev app as well
-- in prod, it's all the same: have an oauth prod app pointing to the server, and have a recurse domain for the prod app

- this is a flask app; make a python venv, activate it, install requirements, run it using `python server.py`# rc3-web-ui
